# rusty_docs 0.2
An automated doc generator for front end applications

## The scenario
Have you been workig on a huge application, either your own or an api for work, and you felt a little *rusty* on what does what. You or your team just has not had the time for making documentation for your api because everyone is working at 1001% efficency? Well then `rusty_docs` s for you. Written it rust, `rusty_docs` needs only a `.json` to kick things off. More documentation files will be coming soon.

## The mindset
`rusty_docs` is meant to be modular and causomizeable. So if you need to implement something `rusty_docs` uses `impl gtsx::GenerateTsx` to document things like functions, parameters, classes and errors. So if you have a data structure that is not implemented, rusty docs has your back.
